# Home Lab

This repository contains all configurations and documentation for my home lab.

## Web accessible 

- [Grafana](grafana.yuandrk.net)
- [Weave GitOps](https://weave.yuandrk.net/)
  

## Tooling

- [k3s](https://docs.k3s.io/) - Lightweight Kubernetes distribution.
- [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) - GitOps tool for Kubernetes.

## Goals

- **Monitoring Stack**: Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring services.
- **Project Hosting**:
  - [Teledoist](https://github.com/yuandrk/teledoist) - A personal project.
  - [Weawe]
  - [OpenWeb](https://openwebui.com/) - A project aimed at open web interfaces.
    - Ensure services are accessible via URLs using:
      - Ingress
      - TLS encryption
      - DNS configuration with AWS Route 53
- **Deployment Strategy**:
  - Utilize Flux for GitOps.
  - Implement a solution for managing secrets securely.

## Todo

- [x] Install Flux.
- [x] Configure Terraform.
- [x] AWS Route53
- [ ] Store secrets in AWS Secrets   
- [ ] Implement SOPS for secret management.

## Using k3s

K3s provides a streamlined Kubernetes experience, which is ideal for personal labs where simplicity and quick setup are prioritized over the comprehensive configuration offered by tools like kubeadm. This approach allows me to focus on learning about deploying and maintaining infrastructure in a lightweight and enjoyable manner.
